# Companion Cube [![Emzi's Central Dispatch][0]][2]
Companion Cube source code is no longer publicly available. You might be
interested in [Music Turret][3] instead.

## Will you take my money?
Yes. I'm tired of providing software for free anyways. You can use any of the
following options to satistfy your desires:
- [GitHub sponsors][4]
- [PayPal][5]
- [Ko-Fi][6]

## But I need to shamelessly steal your C# Discord eval without attributing you or following the license terms!
What you seek can be found on [my GitLab][7].

## What if my question is not answered by this brief, and unexhaustive FAQ?
Then you have a problem. Your options are to cry, or perhaps see if it can be
answered on my Discord.
