## ABOUT

Companion Cube is a Discord bot built on top of [DSharpPlus library](https://github.com/NaamloosDT/DSharpPlus). It was primarily designed to replace Abalwareâ„¢ in Discord API, but during development I also decided to add some fun features (such as currency).

More information is available on [its GitHub page](https://emzi0767.github.io/discord/companion_cube/).

## BUILDING

You need .NET Core SDK 2.0 to build the project, and .NET Core 2.0.0 runtime to run it. Both are available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core ".NET Core download page").

1. In order to build this project, you will need to add the following package sources to your NuGet:
   * `https://www.myget.org/F/dsharpplus-nightly/api/v3/index.json`
   * `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/roslyn/api/v3/index.json`
2. Next, you must restore all NuGet packages (`dotnet restore`).
3. Then build the code in Release mode (`dotnet build -c Release`).
4. Finally publish the bot (`dotnet publish -c Release`).
   * You can optionally package it as a self-contained application by specifying target RID such as `linux-x64` or `linux-arm` (`dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64`).

## SETUP

In order for bot to run, you will need to set up your environment. 

### POSTGRESQL DATABASE

1. If you haven't done so already, install PostgreSQL server (version 9.6 or better).
2. Create a database for bot's data.
3. Create a user for the database.
4. Execute the attached `schema_v1.sql` script as the created user.
5. Execute `CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;` as `postgres` user in the database.

### THE BOT ITSELF

1. Create a directory for the bot.
2. Copy the publish results to the directory.
3. Run the bot (`dotnet Emzi0767.CompanionCube.dll`). This will generate an empty config file.
   * If you packaged the bot as a self-contained app, you will need to run the bot's executable. That is `Emzi0767.CompanionCube.exe` for Windows, or `./Emzi0767.CompanionCube` for GNU/Linux.
4. Fill the config file with proper values.

## RUNNING THE BOT

Execute `dotnet Emzi0767.CompanionCube.dll`. That's it, the bot is running.

If you packaged the bot as a self-contained app, you will need to run the bot's executable. That is `Emzi0767.Devi.exe` for Windows, or `./Emzi0767.Devi` for GNU/Linux.

It is recommended you run the bot in a terminal multiplexer, such as `screen` or `tmux` when running on GNU/Linux.
